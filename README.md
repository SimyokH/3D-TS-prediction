# 3D-TS-prediction
Source code and details of the paper
## 🎨 DESCRIPTION
🔖A machine learning algorithm was developed for efficiently predicting the 3D (Three-Dimensional) spatiotemporal evolution process of tidal currents and analyzing their spatial distribution characteristics. 
> Tidal current energy has great potential for economic development (Dettner et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2023). Tidal currents exhibit substantial variations not only in different water areas, but also across different water depths. Accurate predicting the time-sequence process of 3D (three-dimensional) tidal current movement in future periods plays an important role in the scheduling and allocation of tidal current energy generation, such as guiding tidal stream turbines. Furthermore, analyzing the spatial distribution characteristics of tidal currents (i.e., the similarity of spatial variation processes) can effectively reveal the distribution and evolution patterns of tidal currents, enabling rapid forecasting. For example, reconstructing tidal current fields using a limited set of representative regional tidal currents allows for the prediction of the entire regional tidal current based on the relationships between different regional tidal currents.
